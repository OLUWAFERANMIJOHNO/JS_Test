# JS exercise 
Do: 
FIRST, create a <form> with one input field (Task), a label for this input and one button (Add). 
THEN, on submit of the form, gather user's input, turn JS data into JSON data, and save to Local Storage in the form of an Array of Strings, 
AND create a <h3>  tag and display the tasks as a list,
AND reset/empty the task input (so that the user can enter a new task). 
NOW, make sure that when the user adds another task, it is added to the Array of Strings in Local Storage.

Use: 
addEventListener 
destructuring
JSON.stringify
localStorage
